# bump-default-version.sh - Set default_version in one or more .control files
#
# Usage: bump-default-version.sh <new_version> <control_file> [<control_file> ...]
#
# Rewrites each control file's default_version line to <new_version>, preserving
# everything else on that line (e.g. a trailing comment) and leaving the rest of
# the file untouched.
#
# Invoked by `make post-tag-version-bump` (see base.mk), run by hand right
# after a new release tag is created, to move default_version to a
# placeholder alias (PGXNTOOL_POST_TAG_VERSION, default "stable") so ongoing
# development doesn't silently regenerate and overwrite the just-tagged
# version's versioned SQL file.
