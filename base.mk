# test/install: Run setup files before all tests in the same pg_regress session
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: Runs files from test/install/ before all test/sql/ files within a
#          SINGLE pg_regress invocation via schedule files. This ensures that
#          state created by install files (tables, extensions, etc.) persists
#          into the main test suite.
#
# IMPORTANT: test/install does NOT get a real pg_regress diff, unlike every
# other test type pgxntool supports. Its schedule entries reference the
# original file via a relative "../install/<name>" path, so pg_regress
# resolves BOTH the expected output and the actual output to the exact same
# file (test/install/<name>.out) -- the actual run silently overwrites the
# expected file in place, rather than ever comparing it against anything. A
# content difference (wrong output, a changed column, whatever) will NEVER
# fail this way, no matter how it changes -- see issue #97.
#
# The only thing that forces the build to fail is psql's own exit code: a
# statement that raises a hard error only aborts psql (non-zero exit, which
# pg_regress does report as a failure) if ON_ERROR_STOP is set. So it is
# entirely up to each test/install/*.sql file to `\set ON_ERROR_STOP on` (or
# `\i test/pgxntool/psql.sql`, which already does) if it wants failures
# caught at all. check-test-install-error-stop below enforces this by
# default; see PGXNTOOL_ENABLE_TEST_INSTALL_ERROR_STOP_CHECK to disable it.
#
# Why not just force `-v ON_ERROR_STOP=1` onto the psql invocation instead of
# checking each file? Because test/install and test/sql run inside the same
# pg_regress invocation -- forcing it there would also apply to test/sql,
# breaking any test file that deliberately triggers an error mid-file and
# keeps going to check what happens next, a normal pg_regress pattern.
# That's too big an API change to make silently; the per-file opt-in keeps
# test/sql semantics untouched.
#
# This is intentional, documented behavior -- not a bug to be fixed quietly.
#
# Variable: PGXNTOOL_ENABLE_TEST_INSTALL

# This ERROR-scanning safeguard is only possible because test-build writes

# expected/ and results/ distinct there) -- test/install intentionally does

# don't generally care about test-build's own output content, but when a

# it points straight at the problem instead of leaving you to comb through

# install broke, run-test-build.sh errored, pg_regress couldn't even
# connect -- in which case test/build/results/*.out is stale leftovers from
# whatever run last populated it, and blessing it would silently paper over
# the real failure instead of surfacing it. We clear regression.diffs
# beforehand and only treat a failure as "there's a diff to bless" if it
# comes back non-empty: pg_regress can leave a stale *empty* diffs file on
# disk from a run that bailed before comparing anything (observed when the
# target Postgres instance was unreachable), so mere existence isn't

# post-tag-version-bump: freeze a just-released version, move to a placeholder
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: control.mk.sh always regenerates the *current* version's SQL file
#          (the one named after default_version) from the base sql/{ext}.sql on
#          every `make`. Once a version has actually been released, further
#          edits to sql/{ext}.sql would silently regenerate and overwrite that
#          release's versioned SQL file the next time `make` runs. Moving
#          default_version to a placeholder freezes it, without having to pick
#          an arbitrary next semver number.
#
# Deliberately NOT wired into `tag`/`dist`: both of those are routinely
# invoked outside of an actual release (e.g. by this project's own test
# suite, or a CI job packaging a build for inspection), and `dist` in
# particular is documented and tested to leave the repository clean --
# unconditionally dirtying a tracked .control file on every such run would
# both break that guarantee and risk bumping default_version on a version
# nobody actually meant to release yet. Invoke this target yourself as an
# explicit step in your own release process, right after the tag you're
# actually releasing has been created and pushed. Since it only ever runs
# when explicitly invoked, it has no PGXNTOOL_ENABLE_* toggle -- to opt out,
# simply don't call it.
#
# Variable: PGXNTOOL_POST_TAG_VERSION
#   - The placeholder value default_version is bumped to
#   - Default: "stable" -- not valid semver, but PostgreSQL doesn't require
